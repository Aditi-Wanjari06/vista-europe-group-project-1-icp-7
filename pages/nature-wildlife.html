    <p class="info">Thus millions of the Europeans still live near places where you can hear wolfs howl at night, 
      where bears walk on forest paths and where, <br/>
       in the fall of summer, you can see mighty buffalo engaged in a fight.
       For centuries, wild nature has been pushed back into the most remote places however,<br/> despite that,
        modern society has managed to develop not only a new relationship to restrained nature, 
        it has also come up with new ways to protect it.<br/>
      Establishment of non-state reservations is one of the 
      possibilities of preserving wild nature in Europe for future generations</p>

        <h2 class="card-title">1. Lynx in Romania</h2>
        <p>If you want to see lynx in the wild, your best chances can be found on guided wildlife tours in Romania.

                    <p> In the summer months, the Ligurian Sea is a haven for whales and dolphins. Located between Italy and Corsica,
                       the region has established the Pelagos Sanctuary, a transboundary marine protected area. 
                       The sanctuary supports the preservation of the area,s unique marine ecology, currently 
                       threatened by human activity.
                       Thanks to the sanctuary, several whale-watching companies operate in the area. The Mediterranean 
                      Sea is a feeding ground for whales and home to a wide range of cetacean species.
                        So if you want to go dolphin- and whale-spotting in Italy, this is where to be.
